# robot_vesion

To start you will need to install some libraries like open-cv, we recommend contrib because it already has some additional packages such as ArUco (not used in this example)
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install numpy
pip install mediapipe
```

if there is any problem with install try to add pyhton -m 
```
python -m pip install mediapipe

```



I will also attatch the python script for robodk detect.py
